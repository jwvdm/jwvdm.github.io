I am an Associate Professor (Universitair Hoofddocent) at the University of Amsterdam. I direct the [AMLab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/), co-direct the [UvA Bosch Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/), and direct the [Amsterdam ELLIS Unit](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/). My research focuses on AI methods for scalable and data-efficient scientific computation. This includes methods development in generative AI, deep learning, and probabilistic programming. I also collaborate extensively in a range of application domains. In the past I have worked on problems in biophysics, neuroscience, healthcare, and robotics. My current collaborations focus on physical chemistry, fluid mechanics, and materials science.

I previously held a position as an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University. Prior to becoming faculty at Northeastern, I held a postdoctoral position with Frank Wood at Oxford, as well as a postdoctoral position with Chris Wiggins and Ruben Gonzalez at Columbia University. I carried out my PhD research in biophysics at Leiden and Cambridge with Wim van Saarloos and Ray Goldstein. I served as a founding co-chair of the international conference on probabilistic programming ([PROBPROG](https://probprog.cc/)) and served as a program chair for the international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics ([AISTATS](https://aistats.org/aistats2023/)). I was the recipient of numerous grants, including an NWO Rubicon Fellowship and an NSF CAREER award.
