I am an Associate Professor (Universitair Hoofddocent) at the University of Amsterdam, where I direct the [AMLab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/), co-direct the [UvA Bosch Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/), and direct the [Amsterdam ELLIS Unit](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/).

My research develops principled methods for generative AI and probabilistic inference, with a focus on methods for scalable and data-efficient scientific computation. This includes scalable neural architectures for physical systems, learned surrogate models, and deep generative models for molecular and materials design. A particular ongoing interest is *variational flow matching* — a framework that reformulates flow-based generative models through a variational lens, enabling principled approaches to discrete and structured data, controlled generation, and test-time conditioning. I collaborate closely with domain scientists in physical chemistry, fluid mechanics, and materials science.

Earlier in my career I worked extensively on *probabilistic programming* — designing languages and inference algorithms that allow researchers to express complex probabilistic models as programs. This led to the development of Anglican, foundational work on inference methods for universal probabilistic programs, and a [textbook](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10756). 

Prior to joining the University of Amsterdam, I was an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University. I carried out my PhD research in biophysics at Leiden and Cambridge with Wim van Saarloos and Ray Goldstein, and held postdoctoral positions with Frank Wood at Oxford and with Chris Wiggins and Ruben Gonzalez at Columbia. I was a founding co-chair of the international conference on probabilistic programming ([PROBPROG](https://probprog.cc/)) and a program chair for [AISTATS 2023](https://aistats.org/aistats2023/).
