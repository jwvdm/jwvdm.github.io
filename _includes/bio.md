I am an Associate Professor (Universitair Hoofddocent) at the University of Amsterdam, where I co-direct the [AMLab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) with Max Welling. I am also an Assistant Professor (on leave) at Northeastern University, where I continue to advise and collaborate.

My research develops models for artificial intelligence by combining probabilistic programming and deep learning. Our work seeks to understand what inductive biases can enable models to generalize from limited data. These inductive biases can take the form of a simulator that incorporates knowledge of an underlying physical system, causal structure, or symmetries of the underlying domain. We combine model development with research on methods for inference in these models. We also put this work into practice in collaborations with researchers in robotics, NLP, healthcare, and the physical sciences. 

The technical backbone in much of our work is probabilistic programming. I am one of the creators of [Anglican](https://probprog.github.io/anglican/index.html), a probabilistic language based on Clojure. My group currently develops [Probabilistic Torch](https://github.com/probtorch/probtorch), a library for deep generative models that extends PyTorch. I am writing a book on probabilistic programming, a draft of which is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10756). I am also a co-chair of the international conference on probabilistic programming ([PROBPROG](https://probprog.cc/)).
