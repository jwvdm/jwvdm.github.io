I am an Associate Professor (Universitair Hoofddocent) at University of Amsterdam, where I co-direct the [AMLab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) with Max Welling. I am also an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University, where I am currently on leave. My group combines probabilistic programming with deep learning to develop probabilistic models for machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. I am one of the creators of [Anglican](https://probprog.github.io/anglican/index.html), a probabilistic programming system that is closely integrated with Clojure. My group is currently developing [Probabilistic Torch](https://github.com/probtorch/probtorch), a library for deep generative models that extends PyTorch. 

<!-- I did a post-doc in the group of [Frank Wood](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/) at Oxford. I did a [PhD](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/15949) in biophysics with [Ray Goldstein](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold) (Cambridge) and [Wim van Saarloos](http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/~saarloos) (Leiden). I have also worked on applications of machine learning in single-molecule biophysics at Columbia with [Chris Wiggins](http://www.columbia.edu/~chw2/) and [Ruben Gonzalez](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/gonzalez/index.html).
