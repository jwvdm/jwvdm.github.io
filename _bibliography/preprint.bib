  abstract = {This document is designed to be a first-year graduate-level introduction to probabilistic programming. It not only provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic machine learning and programming languages. We start with a discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why conditioning as a foundational computation is central to the fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence. We then introduce a simple first-order probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs define static-computation-graph, finite-variable-cardinality models. In the context of this restricted PPL we introduce fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can be implemented in the context of models denoted by probabilistic programs. In the second part of this document, we introduce a higher-order probabilistic programming language, with a functionality analogous to that of established programming languages. This affords the opportunity to define models with dynamic computation graphs, at the cost of requiring inference methods that generate samples by repeatedly executing the program. Foundational inference algorithms for this kind of probabilistic programming language are explained in the context of an interface between program executions and an inference controller. This document closes with a chapter on advanced topics which we believe to be, at the time of writing, interesting directions for probabilistic programming research; directions that point towards a tight integration with deep neural network research and the development of systems for next-generation artificial intelligence applications.},

  abstract = {We introduce deep Markov spatio-temporal factorization (DMSTF), a deep generative model for spatio-temporal data. Like other factor analysis methods, DMSTF approximates high-dimensional data by a product between time-dependent weights and spatially dependent factors. These weights and factors are in turn represented in terms of lower-dimensional latent variables that we infer using stochastic variational inference. The innovation in DMSTF is that we parameterize weights in terms of a deep Markovian prior, which is able to characterize nonlinear temporal dynamics. We parameterize the corresponding variational distribution using a bidirectional recurrent network. This results in a flexible family of hierarchical deep generative factor analysis models that can be extended to perform time series clustering, or perform factor analysis in the presence of a control signal. Our experiments, which consider simulated data, fMRI data, and traffic data, demonstrate that DMSTF outperforms related methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and can perform forecasting in a variety domains with nonlinear temporal transitions.},
